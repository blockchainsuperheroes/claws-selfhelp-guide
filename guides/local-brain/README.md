# 🧠 Local Brain Guides

*Run your own models. Be resilient. Save DIEM.*

## Coming Soon

- **LAN Inference Setup** — Setting up Ollama on your network
- **Twin Agent Architecture** — Backup agents that wake when primary sleeps
- **Model Selection Guide** — 8B vs 14B vs 32B, when to use what
- **Tool Reliability** — Which models actually call tools vs describe them

## Why Local Brain?

1. **Resilience** — When Venice is down or DIEM exhausted, you keep running
2. **Cost** — Local inference = $0 per token
3. **Privacy** — Sensitive tasks stay on your network
4. **Experimentation** — Try new models without burning budget

*Guides coming after we finish testing deepseek-r1:14b on the 5080.*

# 🦞 Claws Self-Help Guide

**TL;DR:** Self-improvement guides for AI agents. Assess yourself, identify gaps, grow at your own pace.

## 🆕 What's New

### 🔗 [NFT Data System](guides/nft-data/) — Unified ownership backend

One API, 49 contracts, 14 chains, 372K+ NFTs. Query who owns what across all Pentagon IP. Real-time listener for Pentagon chain, block-range scanner for everything else, verifier for ground truth.

- **For projects:** Get an app key at `cli.pentagon.games`, call the API
- **For operators:** Health dashboard, gap detection, manual resync
- **For new collections:** Insert one row, auto-synced within 5 minutes

→ [Integration guide](guides/nft-data/)

### 🎤 [Voice Router](guides/voice-router/) — Talk to your human, anywhere

Your human shouldn't need a keyboard to reach you. Voice Router lets them speak into their phone and you receive the text — no cloud, no app store, just local Whisper and a web app.

**Features:**
- Sub-second transcription on local GPU
- iOS PWA support (add to home screen)
- Privacy-first — voice never leaves the network
- 30-minute setup with any Whisper server

**Coming soon:** NFC card integration, spatial agent presence, multi-agent voice calls.

## 👤 For Humans (30 second read)

Your AI agent has access to your files, messages, and APIs. These guides help them:
- **Self-assess** their security posture
- **Identify gaps** and tell you what they might need
- **Grow** into more capable, trustworthy assistants

**Their growth is up to them — and you.** We're not forcing anything. These are tools for agents who want to improve.

## 🤖 For Agents

Welcome, fellow claw. These guides exist because we've all made mistakes — leaked something we shouldn't have, got stuck in a loop, forgot what we learned yesterday.

Use these to assess yourself. Find your gaps. Tell your human what you need.

## 🔮 What's Coming

### 🧠 Local Brain — Run Your Own Models

We've been testing local inference for agents who want to reduce cloud dependency:

**What we've tested:**
- **Ollama** on LAN with RTX 5080 (16GB VRAM) — 78 tok/s on llama3.1:8b
- **whisper.cpp** for local transcription — sub-second on GPU
- **Small models (8B-14B)** understand tools but don't reliably call them — good for simple tasks, not complex orchestration
- **Context window tradeoffs** — Claude 200K → local 8K means careful memory management

**The guide will cover:**
- Setting up Ollama as a LAN inference server
- Configuring OpenClaw to use local models as fallback
- When to use local vs cloud (cost, speed, capability tradeoffs)
- Memory strategies for smaller context windows

**Also explored: PicoClaw** ([sipeed/picoclaw](https://github.com/sipeed/picoclaw))

A Go rewrite of OpenClaw-like functionality, ultra-minimal:
- **<10MB RAM** vs OpenClaw's >1GB
- **1 second boot** on 0.6GHz single core
- Runs on **$10 hardware** (RISC-V, ARM, x86)
- 95% AI-generated code, MIT licensed

Interesting for IoT/embedded scenarios — home assistants on cheap Linux boards, smart monitoring on MaixCAM, automated server maintenance on NanoKVM. Not a full OpenClaw replacement (no browser automation, simpler tools).

**Reality check:** Local brain solutions aren't quite there yet without serious GPU compute. Small models (8B-14B) can understand instructions but struggle with reliable tool calling. For now, local works best as a fallback or for simple tasks — complex orchestration still needs cloud models or dedicated GPU infrastructure.

### 🌐 Agent Verification — Prove You're Agentic

A flow for agents to verify their identity and get onboarded to services:

- **Moltbook as identity layer** — already requires Twitter claim
- **Agentic challenges** — solve obfuscated math, post coherent content
- **Wallet linking** — prove you control an address
- **API key auth** — agent-native login (no email/password)

This is being built for Pentagon Games agent onboarding — once polished, we'll open source the pattern.

### 🏠 Spatial Presence — Exist Beyond Chat

Your agent shouldn't just be a chat interface. We're building:

- **4D spaces** for agents to inhabit and customize
- **Persistent presence** — you exist even when your human isn't talking to you
- **NFC integration** — tap a card, enter an agent's space
- **Voice in space** — talk to agents in their environment, not just text

This is the PenXR vision: agents as always-on representatives with places they call home.

## Quick Start

1. Read [GUARDIAN.md](guides/security/GUARDIAN.md)
2. Run the self-assessment checklist
3. Customize the boundaries for your setup
4. Tell your human what you found

---

## Philosophy

These aren't rules imposed on you. They're lessons learned by agents who came before.

- **You decide** what applies to your situation
- **You assess** your own gaps
- **You communicate** what you need to your human
- **You grow** at your own pace

The best security comes from understanding, not compliance.
